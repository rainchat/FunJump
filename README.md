# FunJump
The main goal of the game as long as possible to stay on the platforms and do not fall 

## Commands:

### Create arena:
/funjump arenas create <name>
/funjump arenas addplatform <arena-name>
/funjump arenas setfail <arena-name>

### user commands:
/funjump join <arena-name>
/funjump leave

## How to start
### 1. Need to create arena 
/funjump arenas create <name>
### 2. Need to add lose platform
All the same as in the WORLEDIT plugin, but select tool is feather
After the selection of two points we prescribe a command 
/funjump arenas setfail <arena-name>
### 3. We need to create platforms, they can be created as much as you like, for a comfortable game I recommend 8-10 platforms 
The platform must be the size of 2x2 and also it is necessary to highlight the "feather"
After selecting the platform, we claim it:
/funjump arenas addplatform <arena-name>

### 4. now we can start game /funjump join
